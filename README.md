## A python marketplace scraper
was bored so decided to make a marketplace scraper.
right now only a ss.com scraper (will maybe also have other marketplace scrapers in the future).


if you wanna use it from the source code rn, you need to put python .venv (python virtual machine) in the projects folder.


# Rn using
| :> | version |
| :--- | :--- |
| Python | 3.12.10 |
| CustomTkinter | 5.2.2 |
